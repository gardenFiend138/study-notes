# TCP/ IP

[TCP/ IP Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpsEaqJV_A0)

TCP === 'Transmission Control Protocol'
IP === 'Internet Protocol'

Layers:
1. Application Layer
  * HTTP protocol, SMTP (email) for example
2. Transport Layer
  * TCP, UDP (low latency--online games)

Application layer talks to transport layer through ports

TCP adds a header to each packet with the order in which packets should be 'assembled'

3. Internet Layer

4. Network Layer
  * so packets go to the correct machine, and transmit packets to electrical impulses that are read by your machine
