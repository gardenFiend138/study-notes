# HTML5 Features

What I already knew about: more semantic tags, canvas, SVG elements.

## New Features 
* Semantic tags (nav, header, footer, section, article, aside, section)
  * accessability and readibility increase (ARIA W3; makes it easier for screen readers)

* Video and Audio Support 
  * `<video>` & `<audio>` tags 
  
* `<!DOCTYPE html>`
  * tells the browser what type of document to expect; easier now than it was before 
  
* Cleaner Code 
  * more descriptive semantic tags 
  
* Smarter storage 
  * local storage feature; like a mix of cookies and client-side DB; allows for storage across multiple windows

* Better interactions 
  * drag and drop 
  * offline storage DB 
  * canvas 
  
* Game Development 
  * using `<canvas>` to create browser games 
  
* Legacy/ Cross Browser Support 
  * all browsers support HTML5; that is, they can all use the <!DOCTYPE > tag, but all HTML5 tags may not be available (*cough*cough* IE)
  
* Mobile Support 
  * Viewport: allows you to define viewport widths and zoom settings
  * Full screen browsing: IOS specific values that allow Apple devices to display in full screen mode
  * Home Screen Icons: like favicons on desktop, these icons are used to add favorites to the home screen of an IOS and Android mobile device
