# Graphs

* contrasting linear data structures and graphs 
  * arranged in linear ways (i.e.: arrays, linked lists)
  * non-linear (i.e.: trees, graphs)
  
* Graphs are nodes/ vertices connected by edges
  * contrast with trees: trees have n - 1 edges (1 edge per parent/child relationship)
    * trees are by definition also grpahs, but are graphs that follow a certain set of rules (depending on the tree type [binary, binary search, n-ary, etc])
  * graphs have no rules dictating connections between nodes 
  * edges can connect nodes in multiple ways 
  * study of graphs is referred to as graph theory 
    * G = (V, E)
    * a graph is an ordered pair of a set of vertices and a set of edges
      * (a, b) != (b, a) if a !=b 
    * unordered pair is denoted by curly braces 
      * {a, b} == {a, b}
